				This is a primer for tauclock v0.16<br>
				<br>
				tauclock uses a 24 hour clock, with hours
				numbered from 00 (midnight, or 12:00 am)
				to 23 (11:00 pm)<br>
				<br>
				The very center of the clock shows the current
				time in the currently selected timezone.  In
				this case 18:55, or 6:55 PM.<br>
				<br>
				Above the current time is the weekday name,
				as well as the month name and day.<br>
				<br>
				Below the current time is the current location
				latitude and longitude, as well as the ISO8601
				representation of the date.<br>
				<br>
				This clock has only one hand, the "now hand",
				indicating the current time.  This is a solid
				white line, which in this example appears
				horizontally to the right, from the inner 
				white circle to the outer white circle.<br>
				<br>
				Along the inside edge of the outside circle
				are small numbers and ticks indicating the
				hours.<br>
				<br>
				The section between the inner circle and
				outer circle is partitioned into various
				colors.<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Yellow indicates daylight,
						when the Sun is above the horizon.</li>
					<li>Orange indicates civil twilight, when the
						Sun is just below the horizon.<br>This is
				generally considered bright enough for
				most people to see well without help.</li>
					<li>Light Blue indicates nautical twilight.<br>
				This is the period of time sailors
				can begin to take readings from the
				brightest stars.</li>
					<li>Medium Blue indicates
						astronomical twilight.<br>During this time,
				most casual observers would regard the
				sky as fully dark, especially under
				urban or suburban light pollution.</li>
					<li>Dark Blue indicates complete darkness.</li>
				</ul>
				Printed times at color transitions indicate when transitions
				will occur.  In this example, the morning transition from
				orange to yellow, indicating Sunrise, occurs at 07:30.
				A printed time also appears at the top of the dial, indicating
				when the Sun will be at its highest point, or "transit"<br>
				<br>
				Hours and minutes of daylight and darkness are also given.<br>
				<br>
				Just outside the inner circle is a depiction of the phase of
				the Moon.  During the course of the Lunar month, this depiction
				will travel clockwise around the inner circle.  If it is on the
				right side, as in this example, it is "waxing" (getting bigger),
				and if it is on the left side it is "waning" (getting smaller).
				If it is generally above the inner circle it is "crescent", and
				if it is generally below the inner circle it is "gibbous" (Latin for "hump").
				New Moon occurs when the depiction is directly above the inner
				circle, and Full Moon occurs when the depiction is directly
				below the inner circle.<br>
				<br>
				If the Moon is above the horizon, it will have a white ring around
				it, as shown in this example.  If it is below the horizon, the ring
				around the moon will be a dark gray.<br>
				<br>
				Outside the outer circle are a series of colored arcs depicting the rise, transit,
				and set times of various visible bodies.  Starting from the inside
				and working out, they are:
				<ul>
					<li>Purple for the moon</li>
					<li>Gray for Mercury</li>
					<li>White for Venus</li>
					<li>Red for Mars</li>
					<li>Orange for Jupiter</li>
					<li>Light Blue for Saturn</li>
					<li>Green for the first point of Aries, which
						is a sort of astronomical landmark.</li>
				</ul>
				Traditional astronomical symbols for these objects appear alongside the arcs,
				in the appropriate colors.<br>
				</br>

				In the lower right of the image is text that reads "JD=".  This indicates
				the Julian Day used to generate the image.  The Julian Day is the continuous
				count of days since the beginning of the Julian period, and is used primarily
				by astronomers.  It appears here for debugging purposes.
			</td>

				In the upper left is a "Location" button.  Pressing this will cycle through
				the various location providers.  Text in the upper left indicates the current
				location provider.  Not all providers are available on all devices, and
				some providers may be disabled in the Android system settings.
				The location providers are:
				<ul>
					<li>best (let Android chose what is best for this device</li>
					<li>fused (uses a combination of GPS and Network providers)</li>
					<li>gps (uses GPS satellites to determine location)</li>
					<li>network (uses Cellular of WiFi network)</li>
					<li>passive (only updates if some other app asks for location)</li>
					<li>manual (user selects location, see below)</li>
				</ul>
				The location provider can also be selected through the "Settings" button
				(see below).<br>
				<br>
				If the location provider is "manual", the location can be entered via latitude
				and longitude on the Settings page, OR the user can press anywhere in the dial,
				causing a graphic of the earth to appear, which can then be dragged to the
				desired location. (see below)

				Also appearing along the bottom button row are the "&lt;" and "&gt;" buttons.<br>
				<br>
				When the "Offset Provider" in "Settings" is set to manual, these can be used
				to move the clock forward or backward, day by day.  This is useful to determine
				past or future event times.<br>
			</td>
			<td>
				In the lower left is a "TZ" button.  Pressing this will cycle through
				the various timezone providers.  Text in the lower left indicates the current
				timezone provider, and the timezone given by that provider.
				The timezone providers are:
				<ul>
					<li>system (use the timzeone of the Android device, regardless of location)</li>
					<li>location (use a static database to guess the timezone based on location)</li>
					<li>manual (user selects timezone, see below)</li>
				</ul>
				The timezone provider can also be selected through the "Settings" button
				(see below).<br>
				<br>
				In this example, the timezone provider is "system", which is providing the
				"America/Los_Angeles" timezone.  The two abbreviations for this timezone are
				"PST" (for Pacific Standard Time) and "PDT" (for Pacific Daylight Time), and
				the square brackets around "PDT" indicate that that is the actual timezone
				currently in use.

				The location based timezone is also shown in the lower left.<br>

				Because of axial tilt, things can get strange near the North and South Poles,
				especially around the solstices.
				Sometimes the Sun may not rise or set for days, depending on the
				time of year.  The same is true of the Moon and Planets.
				They may be up for days on end, or never rise at all.
